# Unity-HDRP YouTube-Video Downloader/Player

Whoops I broke the HDRP Demo.. That's ok I'll downgrade this to scripts and plugins only after I upload the theater project.

If you want to use it just add the plugins folder and playMovieVP script (should probably rename that script it's left over from the clip player)

attach script to your screen object (the thing you want to render screen on)... should work in ANYTHING, good luck working with the old code, updates coming within a few days.

Pro Tip: Remove light probes from scripted object mesh renderer component in the inspector to remove darkness.
